// Abstraction: means something that is partially implemented.
// In OOPS: Hiding internal implementation ,just highlight the set of services we are
// offering(helps in security)
// Advantages:
// 1.Security
//  2.Enhancement will become very easy(we can change the implementation without impacting the end user)
//3. Maintainability .

// By using Interface and abstract classes concepts we implements abstraction in java.
